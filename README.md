# JavaScript Null Handling

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error related to null value handling. The `bug.js` file contains a function that attempts to handle null input values. However, more robust null checks might be needed to address edge cases or varying data types. The `bugSolution.js` file offers a possible enhancement to ensure more comprehensive null handling.

## Bug Description

The `foo` function handles null input gracefully, preventing errors by returning `null`.  But more comprehensive logic may be needed if the function must handle null values differently depending on which of the two inputs is null or additional actions are needed besides a null return value.
